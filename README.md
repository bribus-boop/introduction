# Introduction

# Who are you?

Hello! My name is **Brianna Luu** and I'm a senior in Technical Writing and Communications with the IT and design subplan. 

## What topics in writing with digital technologies are you most interested to learn about, and why?

I'm most interested in learning about HTML since I have little experience with it. When Professor Hall was a guest speaker for WRIT 1001, I was very intrigued about the fundamentals of HTML and what results you can get when coding with it. 

## Share any digital writing tools or technologies you may already know, and how you learned them.

I don't have much skills with writing with technology other than some coding experience from other classes. I've attempted Python and Java from classes I took outside of the UMN. I've learned how to use Figma from a Web Design course I took during the Spring semester where I learned the basics of UX design and designing a website for consumers. For a few courses, I taught myself how to use Canva. The main digital technologies I use at my current job are Adobe Audition, Asana, Slack, and PowerPoint Slides to produce lectures for the UMN School of Public Health. In May 2024, I got to participate in a pre-internship opportunity at a film school in St. Paul where I got to learn how to use Adobe Premiere Pro. The programs I learned are mainly focused on design and have taught me a lot about the consumer experience. 

## What topics or skills do you think youâ€™ll use in your future work in technical communication?

I think _HTML_ and _CSS_ would be useful within the technical communication field, especially where some jobs will work closely with engineers and other technology specialists. I think communication skills that can transfer well into technology are a valuable asset since technical writing is used to help general audiences understand what they're reading, especially when it's translated into fields such as healthcare. There are still more digital technologies in technical writing I'd like to learn before or during the start of my future career. In whatever job I decide to work in, I'd like to learn as much as I can to succeed.
